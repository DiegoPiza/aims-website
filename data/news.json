According to witnesses, the squirrel chewed through a power line just in time to prevent an electrical surge that could have destroyed the bakeryâ€™s ovens. The heroic rodent, now affectionately named â€˜Biscuit,â€™ has become a local celebrity, with residents organizing a festival in its honor. The event will feature nut-themed desserts, a tiny squirrel obstacle course, and a statue unveiling in the town square. Organizers hope that the festival will bring the community together and remind everyone of the unexpected ways nature interacts with daily life.In a surprising turn of events, a small town in northern Canada has declared an annual 'Squirrel Appreciation Day' after a particularly bold squirrel saved a local bakery from disaster.
