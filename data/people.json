I completed my neurosurgery residency at Western University followed by a Functional and Epilepsy neurosurgery fellowship at Emory University focussed on advanced surgical neuromodulation (laser ablation, deep brain stimulation, closed loop devices, robotic surgery) for which I received the Royal College Detweiler traveling scholarship. I previously completed my Doctoral degree in biomedical engineering on the topic of image-guided neurosurgery for which I was awarded a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Banting and Best Doctoral scholarship."
